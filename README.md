### Contribution guidelines ###

When starting work on a new user story, create a 'feature' branch named after it in GitFlow. When done, finish your 'feature' in the GitFlow Tab and it will be automatically merged to 'develop'.
When user stories for specified sprint are done, we'll make a new 'release', test it and by finishing it, it gets merged into 'master'.
When a release has bugs, we can create a new 'hotfix' branch to brush up on them quickly, and by finishing 'hotfix' it gets pushed both to 'develop' and 'master'.

Important: when commiting, keep in mind which branch you have selected at the moment. Push only to the branch you commited to. Never push to 'master'. When on a local branch, only pull from the same branch on the remote repository. And, profit! We have it all nice and tidy.
